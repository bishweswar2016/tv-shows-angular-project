# Tv Shows Angular Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.

## Why Choose Angular
I have chosen Angular framework for this project, because I am more comfortable with Angular than Vue.js or React. 


## Prerequisites

### Node and NPM

If Node.js is not already on our machine, Install Node.js Version >= 10.13.x.  We can get Node from following site https://nodejs.org/en.

NPM comes along with Node, so installing node.js will install Node.js and NPM at once.

Lets check the version of Node and NPM by entering commad node -v and npm -v in command prompt respectively.

First need to clone the project in our machine.
