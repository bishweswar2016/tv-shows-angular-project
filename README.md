# TvShowsAngularProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.

## Prerequisites

### Node and NPM

If Node.js is not already on our machine, Install Node.js Version >= 10.13.x.  We can get Node from following site https://nodejs.org/en.

NPM comes along with Node, so installing node.js will install Node.js and NPM at once.

Lets check the version of Node and NPM by entering commad node -v and npm -v in command prompt respectively.

## How to run the project

## Step 1
First need to clone the project in our machine.

## Step 2

## Run Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
